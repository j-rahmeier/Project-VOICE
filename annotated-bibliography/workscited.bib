    abstract = { The object of this paper is to present a set of techniques integrated into a low-lost eye tracking system. Eye tracking systems have many potential applications such as learning emotion monitoring systems, drivers' fatigue detection systems, etc. In this paper, we report how we use an eye tracking system to implement an "eye mouse" to provide computer access for people with severe disabilities. The proposed eye mouse allows people with severe disabilities to use their eye movements to manipulate computers. It requires only one low-cost Web camera and a personal computer. A five-stage algorithm is developed to estimate the directions of eye movements and then use the direction information to manipulate the computer. Several experiments were conducted to test the performance of the eye tracking system. }

abstract = {Gaze is a natural input for a Human Computer Interface (HCI) for disabled people, who have of course an acute need for a communication system. An efficient eye tracking procedure is presented providing a non-invasive method for real time detection of a subject eyes in a sequence of frames captured by low cost equipment. The procedure can be easily adapted to any subject and is adequately insensitive to changing of the illumination. The eye identification is performed on a piece-wise constant approximation of the frames. It is based on a discrete level set formulation of the variational approach to the optimal segmentation problem. This yields a simplified version of the original data retaining all the information relevant to the application. Tracking is obtained by a fast update of the optimal segmentation between successive frames. No eye movement model is required being the procedure fast enough to obtain the current frame segmentation as one step update from the previous frame segmentation.}

    abstract = { Background. Eye trackers are widely used among people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and their benefits to quality of life have been previously shown. On the contrary, Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are still quite a novel technology, which also serves as an access technology for people with severe motor impairment. Objective. To compare a visual P300-based BCI and an eye tracker in terms of information transfer rate (ITR), usability, and cognitive workload in users with motor impairments. Methods. Each participant performed 3 spelling tasks, over 4 total sessions, using an Internet browser, which was controlled by a spelling interface that was suitable for use with either the BCI or the eye tracker. At the end of each session, participants evaluated usability and cognitive workload of the system. Results. ITR and System Usability Scale (SUS) score were higher for the eye tracker (Wilcoxon signed-rank test: ITR T = 9, P = .016; SUS T = 12.50, P = .035). Cognitive workload was higher for the BCI (T = 4; P = .003). Conclusions. Although BCIs could be potentially useful for people with severe physical disabilities, we showed that the usability of BCIs based on the visual P300 remains inferior to eye tracking. We suggest that future research on visual BCIs should use eye trackingâ€“based control as a comparison to evaluate performance or focus on nonvisual paradigms for persons who have lost gaze control. }
