  annote    = { Letterboards are a very common way to assist non-verbal people communicate, but it's a very controversial method to prove higher levels of literacy since the person assisting them through that process could cue them into certain behaviors. This study used eye-tracking to see what letters they focused their gaze on to spell instead. The study reported that the method was very successful, they rarely made any spelling errors, fixated their vision on most letters before pointing to them, and their response time "reflected planning and production processes characteristic of fluent spelling in non-autistic typists" .}

This means that their brain is capable of this level of literacy and are already recognizing sentences and word meaning, so with adequate instruction it might be possible lead them to written forms of communication as an alternative to speech. }

  annote    = {This systematic survey reviews 32 articles that describe and evaluate assistive technologies developed for autistic adults to improve their independence and quality of life. The authors highlight the lack of requirements-driven design and standardized evaluation processes in existing research. They also discuss the importance of involving stakeholders, including caregivers and experts, in the design process and advocate for more research focusing on the generalization and maintenance of acquired skills. The paper concludes with design guidelines and considerations for developing effective assistive technologies for autistic adults, emphasizing the need for continuous user evaluation and the adoption of emerging technologies like AI to enhance individualization and generalization.}

The authors identify four main clusters of assistive technologies: Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC), machine and deep learning, natural language processing, and conversational AI. The study concludes that AI has the potential to greatly improve the lives of children with disabilities, although there are several ethical challenges, such as high costs and privacy concerns, that need to be addressed.}

Researchers tested this system using four different machine learning algorithms and found that adding environmental data significantly improved the accuracy of classifying these movements into categories that could help with communication. The authors concluded that using machine learning in conjunction with environmental data holds promise for supporting communication and improving the quality of life for children with PIMD. Further investigation is needed to understand how the specific levels of these weather features relate to the children's behaviors.}

journal   = {Journal of Medical Internet Research},
year      = {2024},

month     = {July},
annote    = {This study examines the potential and challenges of using AI-powered conversational agents (CAs) in remote healthcare for non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The authors analyzed 43 studies and identified four key findings: high user acceptance of avatar-based CAs, a need for more personalized and empathetic CAs, limited evidence of CAs' efficacy in NCD self-management despite optimism among healthcare professionals, and the predominant use of CAs for non-pharmacological interventions like lifestyle modifications.  The review concludes that AI-based CAs show promise for supporting self-management of chronic conditions but require further development and rigorous evaluation, particularly focusing on data privacy, patient safety, and efficacy in diverse populations and settings.}
