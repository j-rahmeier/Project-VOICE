  annote    = { Letterboards are a very common way to assist non-verbal people communicate, but it's a very controversial method to prove higher levels of literacy since the person assisting them through that process could cue them into certain behaviors. This study used eye-tracking to see what letters they focused their gaze on to spell instead. The study reported that the method was very successful, they rarely made any spelling errors, fixated their vision on most letters before pointing to them, and their response time "reflected planning and production processes characteristic of fluent spelling in non-autistic typists" .}

This means that their brain is capable of this level of literacy and are already recognizing sentences and word meaning, so with adequate instruction it might be possible lead them to written forms of communication as an alternative to speech. }
