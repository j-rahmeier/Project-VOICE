As of February 2011, BCI2000 is distributed under the GNU General Public License
(GPL), version 3.0. You should have received a copy of the GPL along with this
software in LICENSE-GPL.TXT . If not, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/

CLARIFICATION OF SCOPE:

For the convenience of the user, some third-party SDK files (headers, libraries
and DLLs) have been included in the same directory tree as our source release.
Please be aware that the BCI2000 License, and hence the GPL, applies to all files
in which "This file is part of BCI2000" appears in the comments near the top, but
not necessarily to other files. Almost everything in the src/core section of the
distribution is considered to be part of BCI2000, whereas almost everything in
the src/extlib section is not. The rest may be quite a mixed bag. If you
redistribute programs or source code based based on or involving BCI2000, please
take note of the licensing conditions for all the individual files involved.

The BCI2000 license hereby includes permission to redistribute BCI2000 code together
with third party source code, here called an SDK, in cases where the BCI2000 code
in question depends on the SDK, but where the SDK does not depend on BCI2000 code
to perform the functions for which the SDK is provided, and the SDK in no way
specifically adapted to work with BCI2000. This permission applies to the BCI2000
code itself, irrespective of the license conditions of the various SDKs. However,
where an SDK file itself is redistributed, the specific license conditions of the
SDK must also be obeyed. Such SDK code should be considered explicitly excluded
from the "Corresponding Source" of BCI2000 as defined in the GPL section 1.


PLAIN-ENGLISH (OR AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE) INTERPRETATION OF THE GPL

The GPL is designed with the intention of maximizing the benefit that a piece of
software has for society. Since its language necessarily tends to become more
legalistic over time, and since software license agreements in general seem
increasingly to push the boundaries of legal "unconscionability" as they
get more complicated and more pervasive, here is our informal reading of the
GPL's main implications. This informal guide does not capture all of the
conditions in the GPL, and while we think it should not conflict with the
official wording of the GPL, please treat it as FYI only: the official GPL
should be considered definitive.

1. The "free" bit: you may redistribute BCI2000 code, but only if all GPL
stipulations (including this conditional permission to redistribute) remain
intact.  Though charging money for your distribution is permitted, you may not
impose restrictions on the recipients' freedom to redistribute what you give
them. The same stipulations must apply to any modified version of the BCI2000
code, or any binaries built from modified BCI2000 code.

2. The "open" bit: wherever you distribute binaries that contain GPL'd code, you
must also supply the corresponding source code and documentation, at no extra
charge. (If you currently have a BCI2000 distribution that does not include
source code and documentation, these can be obtained from
http://bci2000.org/BCI2000/Download.html )

3. The "viral" bit: you must also apply the GPL when distributing any code that
you have written which uses GPL'd code. When we say your code uses BCI2000, we
mean that your code will not perform its intended function successfully unless
BCI2000 or BCI2000-derived source code or binaries are present. One obvious
example might be that you have written something which makes calls to the
BCI2000 C++ API. If you want to release your code, or binaries built from it,
you must release it under the GPL: if not, your permission to distribute
BCI2000 sources, and any binaries which contain object code built from BCI2000
sources, is withdrawn.  Note the viral spread cannot be expected to flow
"upstream" along a chain of dependencies.  Parts of BCI2000 may depend on
components of Windows, of Matlab or of various amplifier manufacturers' SDKs.
These were all written without consideration of BCI2000 and without exploiting
BCI2000 code, and are therefore not covered.

4. The "as is" bit:  BCI2000 has been useful to some people, and its use has not
resulted in injuries or comparably serious problems as far as we know. It is
distributed to you in the hope that the same will be true when you use it, but
this cannot be guaranteed. It comes WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. Some legislations have
the concept of an "implied warranty", such as "merchantability" and "fitness for
a particular purpose" which apply unless explicitly disclaimed, but we
explicitly disclaim them: NO IMPLIED WARRANTIES APPLY TO BCI2000. If you choose
to use this software, it is up to you to identify and undertake all the
necessary steps to ensure and verify the software's fitness for the purposes you
intend. You use it at your own risk.  For further details, see the GNU General
Public License.

Finally, it should be remembered that licensing software one way does not
preclude an author from supplying it under another license under different
conditions. If you wish to license BCI2000 code in non-GPL ways, please
