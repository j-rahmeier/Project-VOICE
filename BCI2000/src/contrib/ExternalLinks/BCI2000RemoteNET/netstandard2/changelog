BCI2000RemoteNET now targets .NET 8

BCI2000Remote no longer inherits from BCI2000Connection, and instead has a
public member BCI2000Connection.

Execute can still be called, through the member connection variable.

Execute now takes a type parameter specifying the expected return type. The
program will attempt to parse the received response as the return type if it
is not void. 

The Execute method is now the Execute<T> method which

Methods now use exceptions for handling errors.
