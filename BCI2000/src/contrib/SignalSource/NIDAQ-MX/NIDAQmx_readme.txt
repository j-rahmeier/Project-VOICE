NIDAQmx Source Module
The BCI2000-compatible Source Module NIDAQmx.exe can be used instead of any
other source module. In addition to standard parameters (i.e. SampleBlockSize,
SamplingRate, SourceCh), this driver is limited to acquire 128 channels and
the terminal configuration is fixed to Not Referenced Single Ended on a bipolar
range of Â± 5V. This settings could be changed by user only at compilation time
(all the config instruction are placed in the function ADConfig()), please
refer to your hardware manual  for the supported settings.
