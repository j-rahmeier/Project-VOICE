<h1>BioRadio 150 DLL Software Development Kit</h1>
<p>
<h3 align="center">1.5.5.24 </h3><h2><a class="anchor" name="mainIntro">
Introduction</a></h2>
The BioRadio 150 DLL (Dynamic Link Library) provides a software interface to the BioRadio 150, facilitating the development of applications to acquire physiological data, wirelessly.<p>
This document describes the programmatic interface, and outlines the steps involved in configuring and communicating with the device. It supplements the BioRadio 150 User's Guide, which should be referenced for device operation and other specifics.<h2><a class="anchor" name="mainUsage">
Usage and Operation</a></h2>
The DLL encapsulates an object model of the BioRadio 150 system ("device") and its functionality. Calls to DLL functions control this device object, which in turn controls the system devices, themselves, including configuration and data acquisition.<p>
The functions for operating the BioRadio 150 device can be called using a programming tool that supports linking of Win-32 DLLs. The DLL file (BioRadio150DLL.dll) and its corresponding header (<a class="el" href="_bio_radio150_d_l_l_8h.html">BioRadio150DLL.h</a>) should be included in a project that uses the DLL.<h3><a class="anchor" name="mainUsageHandle">
Multiple Devices and the Object Handle</a></h3>
The BioRadio 150 DLL allows for simultaneous operation of multiple BioRadio 150 devices. Each time the <a class="el" href="group___create_destroy.html#gf85bf44f83d0b6383dd727ef810c927e">CreateBioRadio()</a> function is called, a new device object is allocated and initiated, and a reference handle to that object is returned. The handle (for the appropriate device) is then provided to each subsequent function call that requires the parameter <code>unsigned int BioRadio150</code>.<p>
For each physical BioRadio 150 system, only one software device object should exist at any time.<h2><a class="anchor" name="mainDevConf">
Device Configuration</a></h2>
Many data acquisition options are configurable, including the enabling and disabling inputs, and setting of sample rate and resolution. The BioCapture and BioRadio Capture Lite software packages can be used for programming the device and storing configurations to file. Configuration files can also be created in a text editor, described on the <a class="el" href="pageconffiles.html">Configuration Files</a> page.<p>
Current configuration values can be acquired using the DLL interface, and configurations can be programmed to the device from file. Because interaction between Computer Unit and User Unit occurs over the radio link, acquisition must be started in order to send configuration-related commands.<p>
If, for a particular function to operate properly, Communication (communication with the Computer Unit) or Acquisition (communication with the User Unit) must be started, this requirement is listed in the function's documentation.<p>
Please refer to the BioRadio 150 User's Guide for more information on the BioRadio 150 inputs and their configurability.<h2><a class="anchor" name="mainAcq">
Data Acquisition</a></h2>
The main functionality of transferring data -- from User Unit to Computer Unit to PC -- is handled in the background by the device object, which buffers the acquired data for retrieval by the calling application. This (your) calling application, then, can display, archive, or otherwise process the data.<p>
Data from the BioRadio 150 is collected periodically and arrives as a stream of data points, interleaved by input. In general, these data points can be acquired either un-scaled analog-to-digital counts, (2-byte WORDs,) or as double-precision floating-point values, scaled according to the device configuration (see the section on <a class="el" href="index.html#mainDevConf">Device Configuration</a>.)<h3><a class="anchor" name="mainAcqThreading">
Threading</a></h3>
After the device object's acquisition routine has been started, collection involves repeatedly calling <a class="el" href="group___acq.html#g01f79f89e66cfc0d8df20d0e5052f7df">TransferBuffer()</a> (to move data from the PC's serial port to the device object's buffer) then one of the <a class="el" href="group___acq.html">Read...()</a> functions (to move that data into the calling application's buffer.) The application using the DLL should, therefore, have its own timing mechanism to periodically collect data as described. For simplicity in description and distribution, the <a class="el" href="pageexampleprogram.html">Example Program</a> included uses a simple <code>while</code> loop within the main routine to iteratively collect data. The acquisition would more preferably be handled in a separate program thread to ensure that data collection is maintained. Processing, display, and saving of data are executed independently so that the collection of new data isn't held up by processing.<h3><a class="anchor" name="mainAcqCollection">
Periodic Collection</a></h3>
Data over all BioRadio 150 inputs are effectively sampled between 128 and 960 times per second, but become available at the serial port for collection in bundles larger than one sample. The Example Program provided attempts to collect data every 50 ms (milliseconds), an interval chosen to for efficiency of collection, minimizing system overhead while ensuring the buffers are serviced frequently enough so as to not fill and overflow, and to display real-time data smoothly. The rate at which data becomes available at the port will depend on the wireless link and device configuration, and different intervals will suit different applications and computing environments, but an interval of between 25 to 125 ms is suggested.<h2><a class="anchor" name="mainExample">
Example Program</a></h2>
The included Example Program, <a class="el" href="pageexampleprogram.html">BioRadio150SDKExample.cpp</a>, is a simple program which makes use of the DLL's fundamentals, including wireless acquisition of real-time data, and wired downloading and erasing of the device's On-Board memory. Please see the code and its in-line comments for a more detailed explanation. </div>
