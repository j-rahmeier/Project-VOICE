The following files, in this directory structure:

	lib/DLLs/MatlabNetComClient.dll
	lib/Libraries/MatlabNetComClient.lib
	lib/Libraries/libMnc.lib
	lib/Libraries/mn.def

are required to compile this module.

You may be able to copy/make them from your Neuralynx SDK installation.

In January 2012, pending agreement from Neuralynx, Inc, we expect
to be able to distribute these files here ourselves.
