IOTechADC::DoAcquire( GenericSignal& Output )
{
  // Now we're acquiring a single SampleBlock of data in the acquisition thread, which is stored
  // in an internal buffer until the main thread is ready to process it.

  // Internally, BufferedADC writes this data to a buffer, then locks a mutex and pushes the data
  // into the GenericSignal output in the main thread.  The size of this buffer is parameterized by
  // "SourceBufferSize" declared by BufferedADC, which will be interpreted as follows:
  // * When set to a naked number, the number will be rounded to the nearest integer, and specify
  //   the number of BCI2000 data blocks (cf the SampleBlockSize parameter). The buffer's
  //   duration in time will vary with changes to the SamplingRate and SampleBlockSize parameters.
  // * When set to a number followed with an SI time unit, the buffer's size will be automatically
  //   chosen to match the specified time duration as close as possible. By default, the value is 2s.
  //   SI time units must be appended without white space, and consist of
  //   a valid SI prefix (such as m for milli=1e-3, mu for micro=1e-6, k for kilo=1e3),
  //   followed with a lowercase s (for seconds).

  // Keep in mind that even though we're writing this data from another thread, the main thread
  // cannot continue without data, so be sure this is done in a timely manner
  // or the system will not be able to perform in real-time.

  // IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT BUFFERING

  // Ideally, the BCI2000 processing time ("Roundtrip time") is always shorter than the physical
  // duration of a sample block, i.e. every single block of data has been processed before its
  // successor arrives. In that ideal case, buffering makes no difference, because the main thread will
  // always wait for the acquisition thread to deliver the next block of data into the internal
  // buffer, and copy it from there immediately.

  // If, on average, processing takes longer than the physical duration of a sample block, buffering
  // will not help to improve things either, because the buffer will be filled faster than
  // it is being emptied, and thus it will overflow after a certain time. Depending on buffering strategy,
  // buffer overflow may be dealt with by looping (i.e., overwriting data that has not been delivered yet),
  // or by blocking (not accepting any new data before there is space in the buffer).
  // For scientific purposes -- as opposed to, e.g., entertainment applications -- silently omitting
  // data is not an option, so BufferedADC will use the blocking strategy, and deliver all data blocks,
  // but delayed by the physical duration of its buffer.

  // So the _only_ situation in which buffering is actually useful is for cases when processing is not
  // able to keep up with data acquisition for short amounts of time. Typical examples are lengthy 
  // computations that happen from time to time, such as updating a classifier matrix, or initialization
  // work in algorithm implementations that are not factored out into initialization and update operations
  // (otherwise, you would just do lengthy operations inside Initialize()).
  // In such cases, you should set the SourceBufferSize parameter to an estimate of the longest expected
  // delay.
