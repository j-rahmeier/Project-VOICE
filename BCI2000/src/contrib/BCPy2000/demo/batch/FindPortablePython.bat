# The "Full Monty" is a portable Python distribution, which means
# it can be run from (almost) anywhere without installation.
#
# However, in order for this to work:
# (1)  BCI2000 will need to know where Python is.
# (2)  Python will need to know where its own files are.
#
# For this reason, BCI2000 batch files need to call this file,
# FindPortablePython.bat
# 
# The location of python (the PYTHONHOME variable, which on Windows
# should be the parent directory of python.exe) can be set in the
# following ways (in this order of precedence):
# 
# - command-line argument to this script, FindPortablePython
# - environment variable BCPY2000PYTHONHOME
# - environment variable PYTHONHOME
# - a guess, based on the way the downloadable BCPy2000 demo is packaged
# 
# The guess involves identifying the directory where FindPortablePython.bat
# is ( ${extract directory $0} in BCI2000 scripting, %0\.. in dos ),
# and from there we going up (out of prog), up again (out of BCI2000), then
# down into the FullMonty directory, then down into App: that is where
# Python.exe lives in the downloadable demo.
# 
# We determine the full path to python's home, and set the "PYTHONHOME"
# environment variable to that.  This solves problem (2). We also add
# the PYTHONHOME directory, delimited by a semicolon, to
# the list of paths in the system environment variable "Path":  that
# solves problem (1).   Set these two environment variables permanently
# ( Control Panel-> System -> Advanced -> Environment Variables )
# if you wish to permanently "install" your Full Monty distro in a fixed
# location and never worry about this again. If you want different
# PYTHONHOME settings for ordinary Python usage and for BCPy2000 usage,
# set variable PYTHONHOME_BCI2000 instead of PYTHONHOME.
#
# Finally, as a nice-to-have, we set the IPYTHONDIR variable, such that
# IPython shells take their user config from a place we have pre-prepared
# inside the Full Monty distro. This prevents BCI2000-driven IPython
# shells from prompting/distracting the user the very first time they are
# used, and also ensures that some useful shortcuts are loaded.
