/*
Qt programs require a main function, and will generally use a separate class to
handle any form generation. The form is usually made by inherting from a
QMainWindow or QWidget class in the Qt library. In our case, the form is
generated in the mainUI.h/cpp files. All the main function has to do is
create a QApplication object (app), declare our mainUI class (mainWin),
use the show function on mainWin, and then execute the app.

Our Qt deployment scheme requires to use an adapted descendant of QApplication
instead of the plain QApplication from the Qt library.
