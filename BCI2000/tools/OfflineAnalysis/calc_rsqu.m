function [ressq, amp1, amp2] = calc_rsqu(data1, data2, rorrsqu)
%RSQU   [ressq, avgamp1, avgamp2]  = calc_rsqu(data1, data2, rorrsqu) calculates the r2-value for
%       two three-dimensional variables (dim1 by dim2 by trial) data1 and data2
%       the result is ressq (dim1, dim2); each element represents the r2 
%       for this particular combination of dim1, dim2 across trials
%       in addition to r2 values, this function also calculates average amplitudes 
%       for each sample and channel, for both data variables (i.e., conditions), and
%       returns these in amp1 and amp2
%       rorrsqu == 1 ... rsqu values
%                  2 ... r values
